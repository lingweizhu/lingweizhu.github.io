Welcome to my homepage! My name is Lingwei Zhu (朱　令緯), a last-year PhD student at Robot Learning Lab, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) under the supervision of [Takamitsu Matsubara](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RFDSj_0AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interest lies in developing scalable and safe reinforcement learning algorithms for realizing autonomous control of large-scale systems, e.g. industrial processes and robotics.  

I am actively looking for postdoc position that can accommodate my skills. Please see my CV page for detailed personal information.

Currently I am receiving Japan Society for the Promotion of Science scholarship [(JSPS) DC](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html) that has independent research grants. Prior to that, I received Japanese Goverment Scholarship for 2020~2021.
